Stackato Samples
================

The applications in this repository can all be run on ActiveState's
[Stackato](http://activestate.com/cloud) cloud hosting platform.

You'll need a Stackato VM and the stackato client for these
demos. Binaries for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux can be downloaded from
[community.activestate.com](http://community.activestate.com/stackato/download).

If you have ActivePython 2.7 or 3.2, use pypm:

    pypm install stackato
  
If you have ActivePerl 5.12 or 5.14, use ppm:

    ppm install stackato
  
Specific instructions on configuring and pushing are in the README.md
file for each application, as the configuration steps differ slightly
for each one.
