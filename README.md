Stackato Samples
================

The applications in this repository can all be run on ActiveState's Stackato cloud hosting platform.

You'll need a Stackato VM and the stackato client for these demos.

Binaries for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux:

If you have ActivePython 2.6 or 2.7, use pypm:

  pypm install stackato
  
If you have ActivePerl 5.12 or 5.14, use ppm:

  ppm install stackato
  
Specific instructions on configuring and pushing are in the README.md file for each application, as the configuration steps differ slightly for each one.
